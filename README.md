# Sign-up Form 📝
Fictional Sign-up form made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. I used and learned of form validation in this project by the Odin curriculum.
Features: 
- Name, Email and Phone number fields with some client side validation
- Password /Confirm Password fields
- Validate if the passwords match
